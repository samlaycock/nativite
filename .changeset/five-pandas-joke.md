"nativite": patch
---

Add a small visual gap between the iOS keyboard and `chrome.keyboard` input accessory bar.

The generated `NativiteKeyboard.swift` template now separates toolbar height from total accessory height and reserves a fixed gap so accessory controls are no longer flush against the keyboard.
